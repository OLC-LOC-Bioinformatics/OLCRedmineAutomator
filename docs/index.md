# OLC Redmine Automator

To facilitate the sharing of the CFIA's genomic data and tools to analyze this data, we make use of the Redmine
platform. Our instance of Redmine can be found [here](https://redmine.biodiversity.agr.gc.ca) (note that you must be on
the CFIA network in order to access Redmine).

If you have not yet gotten started with Redmine or want to know how the Redmine automator works and what it can do,
take a look at our [Getting Started](getting_started.md) page for instructions on how to start using Redmine and a
brief overview of what Redmine can do.

For any issues or general help with Redmine, see the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) page.
