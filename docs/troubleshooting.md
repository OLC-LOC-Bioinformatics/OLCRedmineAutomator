# Troubleshooting

#### Error Messages

If you get error messages that aren't covered by the descriptions of the tools available, please let us know by sending
us an email.

#### Why are things taking so long?

Our compute cluster does run into situations where all available resources are being used. If that's the case, your job
will wait in queue until compute resources are freed up. This should be a fairly rare occurrence, but it does happen.

#### Contact Info

If you're having issues or want a new tool implemented, email us! For quickest response times, email Andrew with Adam CC'd.
